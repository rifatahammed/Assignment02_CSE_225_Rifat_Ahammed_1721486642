Hey, I am Rifat Ahammed from North South University and here is my CSE225 project about Mobile operator management system.

In this problem ,

1) A person can have multiple phone numbers.

2) According to govt. regulation, no person can have more than 15 phone numbers
assigned to him at any point in time.

3) In case of point 2, if the customer wants to register a new number and his numbers
exceed 15, his request will be denied.

4) NID can have only 11 digits.

5) Operators can be changed for each phone number without changing the numbers

There can be only 5 operators.
1. GP
2. Robi
3. BanglaLink
4. Teletalk
5. KomKothaKoiben
